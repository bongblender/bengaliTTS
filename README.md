# bengaliTTS

This program is a work arround alternetive of a bengali TTS offline solution, using espeak / pyttsx3.

If we try, we can use hindi to spell bengali. I use that logic and made this program, which conver bengali script to hindi.
which we can use in tts operation with pyttsx3.

Its definately not good. but more or less useable with bang-di accent. its almost sound like some hindi speaker trying to
speak bengali.

If you have any other offline solution for bengali TTS. please send a email to thrushbag@gmail.com

Thank you.
